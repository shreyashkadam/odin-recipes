    <div class="sub-headings"><h2>Description</h2></div>
    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been
    coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. 
    The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. 
    Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>

    <p>The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages.
    However, the Scottish were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning).
    Meanwhile, many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken
    (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and
    West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.</p>
